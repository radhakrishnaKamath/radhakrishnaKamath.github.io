This is Radhakrishna Kamath. A *Secular* thinker from India. 

Currently I am doing my MS (research) under the guidence of [Prof. Krishna M Sivalingam](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~skrishnam/) in the field of 5G networks. 

I am also working in the [5G indigenous testbed](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/5g/) project funded by department of Telecommunications, Government of India.

I completed by graduation from [Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology](https://ves.ac.in/vesit/) (Mumbai University)

I am Linux lover (also not a Windows hater), I like to learn new things and to have knowledge about those things rather than becoming a master.

Thats it folks.
