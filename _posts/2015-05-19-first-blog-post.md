Blogging, Really?
======

Yes, I thought of blogging as a means of expressing myself to the people that matter to me the most. I like to write my opinion about things which are kind of taboos, orthodox.

Why only such things?
======

These kinds of things are the reason behind the bad element of our society and it was from the past. So I feel I should write about these things and try to expose both the sides of the coin.

What's the future of this blogging habit?
------

I will try my best to post a new blog post every Thursday.
